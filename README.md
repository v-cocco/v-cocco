Hi! I'm an agricultural and environmental economist, working on policy evaluation at the Center for studies and strategic foresight of the French Ministry of Agriculture. I have a special interest in agricultural landscapes, including landscape features with high environmental value, like hedgerows. I completed my PhD at CIRED and PSAE research labs (Paris-Saclay University, AgroParisTech).
